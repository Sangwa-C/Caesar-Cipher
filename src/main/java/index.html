        <h1>Ceasar Cipher</h1>
        <p>Back in time Julius Ceasar used this method to communicate with his generals! therefore,
            The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. <br>It is a type of substitution cipher
            in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.
            For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. </p>

        <p>fill this form bellow and see our system do its magic by  encrypting the message using  caesar cipher</p>
